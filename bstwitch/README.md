### a minimalistic twitch viewer

My implementation of the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) [twitch API project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api). I skipped this project when I came to it because I couldn't think of how I wanted to do it, but now it's the last thing I have to do the finish the "front end developer" course...
