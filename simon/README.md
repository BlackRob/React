This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```

Simon game made as part of freeCodeCamp's front end developer course. Notable features: built with React; uses an SVG for the drawing and animation of the buttons; web-audio for the tones (no downloading audio files); javascript promises (which made the asynchronicity of the game easy to manage); mobile-first, offline-friendly and responsive design.
